Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project! ðŸ’–

As you get started, you are in the best position to give us feedback on areas of
our project that we need help with including:

- Problems found during setting up a new developer environment
- Gaps in our Quickstart Guide or documentation
- Bugs in our automation scripts

If anything doesn't make sense, or doesn't work when you run it, please open a
bug report and let us know!

## Ways to Contribute

We welcome many different types of contributions including:

- New features
- Builds, CI/CD
- Bug fixes
- Documentation
- Issue Triage
- Answering questions on Slack/Mailing List
- Web design
- Communications / Social Media / Blog Posts
- Release management

Not everything happens through a GitHub pull request. Please come to our
[meetings](#come-to-meetings) or [contact us](#contact-us) and let's discuss how we can work together.

### Come to Meetings

Please consider joining the [Konveyor community meetings](https://github.com/konveyor/community?tab=readme-ov-file#konveyor-community-meetings).

Absolutely everyone is welcome to come to any of our meetings. You never need an
invite to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you donâ€™t have
anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

You can find out more about our meetings [here](https://github.com/konveyor/community?tab=readme-ov-file#konveyor-community-meetings). You donâ€™t have to turn on
your video. The first time you come, introducing yourself is more than enough.
Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable voicing your opinions, giving
feedback on othersâ€™ ideas, and even sharing your own ideas, and experiences.

## Find an Issue

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable
for any contributor. [good first issue](https://github.com/konveyor/kai/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) has extra information to
help you make your first contribution. [help wanted](https://github.com/konveyor/kai/labels/help%20wanted) are issues
suitable for someone who isn't a core maintainer and is good to move onto after
your first pull request.

Sometimes there wonâ€™t be any issues with these labels. Thatâ€™s ok! There is
likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you
donâ€™t know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can reach out to us in [slack](#slack)

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying
that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.

## Ask for Help

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on:

- The original github issue
- [The developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/konveyor-dev)
- [Our Slack channel - #konveyor-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C04QZJFQ0UA)

## Pull Request Lifecycle

- Please submit pull-requests for the 'main' branch
- Please link your PR to an existing issue, if an existing issue is not present consider creating a new issue
- If the PR is not yet ready you may mark it as a draft, and then once it's ready for a review remove the draft status and add a comment to let us know you are ready for a review.

## Pull Request Title

- Please ensure the title of your PR begins with a [gitemoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji) such as
  - `:bug` - For bug fixes
  - `:book` - For documentation
  - `:sparkles` - For new features
  - `:seedling` - For infrastructure related changes
  - `:warning` - For breaking changes
  - `:ghost` - For misc updates/fixes that don't need to show up in release notes
  - For more info you can consult the pr check we run at [konveyor/release-tools](https://github.com/konveyor/release-tools/blob/main/pkg/pr/prefix.go)

## Development Environment Setup

See [docs/contrib/Dev_Environment.md](docs/contrib/Dev_Environment.md)

## Linting

1. Install trunk via: https://docs.trunk.io/check#install-the-cli
1. Run the linters: `trunk check`
1. Format code: `trunk fmt`

## Testing

- Please include a unit test for new features
- See [docs/contrib/Testing.md](docs/contrib/Testing.md) for more guidance on testing

## Updating requirements.txt

- If you are a developer working on Kai and you are updating requirements.txt, you will need to do some manual changes beyond just a `pip freeze &> ./requirements.txt`, we have a few directives that address differences in 'darwin' systems that need to be preserved. These need to be added manually after a 'freeze' as the freeze command is not aware of what exists in requirements.txt. Please consult the diff of changes you are making now from prior version and note the extra directions for `python_version` and or `sys_platform`

## Sign Your Commits

### DCO

Licensing is important to open source projects. It provides some assurances that
the software will continue to be available based under the terms that the
author(s) desired. We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to
our project's repositories. The [Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) is a way to certify that you wrote and
have the right to contribute the code you are submitting to the project.

You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must
match the git user and email associated with the commit.

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com>

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically:

    git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'

If you forgot to do this and have not yet pushed your changes to the remote
repository, you can amend your commit with the sign-off by running

    git commit --amend -s

## Pull Request Checklist

When you submit your pull request, or you push new commits to it, our automated
systems will run some checks on your new code. We require that your pull request
passes these checks, but we also have more criteria than just that before we can
accept and merge it. We recommend that you check the following things locally
before you submit your code:

- Ensure that [trunk](https://docs.trunk.io/code-quality/advanced-setup/cli) is happy
  - `trunk check`
  - `trunk fmt`
- Ensure that unit tests pass
  - See [docs/contrib/Testing.md](docs/contrib/Testing.md)
- If adding a new feature please add a new unit test
- If you modified `requirements.txt` please see [updating requirements.txt](#updating-requirementstxt)
- Ensure that [`example/run_demo.py`](example/run_demo.py) works
- Commits are signed as per [DCO](#dco)
- PR Title begins with a gitemoji as described in [Pull Request Title](#pull-request-title)
