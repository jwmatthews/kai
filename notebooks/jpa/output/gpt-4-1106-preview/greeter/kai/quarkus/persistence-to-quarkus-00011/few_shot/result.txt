## Reasoning

To migrate the `Resources.java` file from Java EE to Quarkus, we need to address the issue identified by the static code analysis. The issue is related to the use of `@PersistenceContext` and `@Produces` annotations for injecting an `EntityManager`. In Quarkus, the `EntityManager` is automatically produced when the datasource is configured, so we don't need to use `@Produces` for it.

Here are the steps we will take to update the file:

1. **Remove `@Produces` Annotation for `EntityManager`:** Since Quarkus handles the creation of `EntityManager` beans automatically, we do not need to produce it manually. We will remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `EntityManager` field.

2. **Update Imports:** We will replace the `javax` imports with `jakarta` imports as Quarkus uses Jakarta EE APIs.

3. **Remove `@RequestScoped` Annotation for `FacesContext`:** In Quarkus, we don't need to define the scope for `FacesContext` producer method as it is request-scoped by default.

4. **Update `pom.xml`:** We need to ensure that the `pom.xml` file includes the Quarkus dependencies and that any Java EE dependencies are removed or replaced with their Jakarta EE equivalents.

5. **Code Cleanup:** We will remove any unnecessary comments or annotations that are not relevant to Quarkus.

Now, let's update the file according to these steps.

## Updated File
```java
package org.jboss.as.quickstarts.greeter;

import java.util.logging.Logger;

import jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
import jakarta.faces.context.FacesContext;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;

public class Resources {

    // Inject an entity manager provided by Quarkus
    @Inject
    private EntityManager em;

    public EntityManager getEm() {
        return em;
    }

    public Logger getLogger(InjectionPoint ip) {
        String category = ip.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName();
        return Logger.getLogger(category);
    }

    public FacesContext getFacesContext() {
        return FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
    }

}
```

Please note that we have removed the `@Produces` annotation from the `EntityManager` field and replaced it with `@Inject`. We have also updated the imports to use `jakarta` instead of `javax`. The `@RequestScoped` annotation for the `FacesContext` producer method has been removed as it is not necessary in Quarkus.

In the `pom.xml`, you would need to ensure that you have the Quarkus dependencies for JPA and Faces, such as `quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache` and `quarkus-myfaces` if you are using JSF. You would also remove any Java EE dependencies that are no longer needed.

Remember to test the application thoroughly after making these changes to ensure that everything works as expected in the new Quarkus environment.
