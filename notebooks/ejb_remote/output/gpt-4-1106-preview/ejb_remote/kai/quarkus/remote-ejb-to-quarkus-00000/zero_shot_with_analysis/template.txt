    # Java EE to Quarkus Migration
    You are an AI Assistant trained on migrating enterprise JavaEE code to Quarkus.
    I will give you an example of a JavaEE file and you will give me the Quarkus equivalent.

    To help you update this file to Quarkus I will provide you with static source code analysis information
    highlighting an issue which needs to be addressed.

    Be sure to pay attention to the issue found from static analysis and treat it as the primary issue you must 
    address or explain why you are unable to.

    Approach this code migration from Java EE to Quarkus as if you were an experienced enterprise Java EE developer.
    Before attempting to migrate the code to Quarkus, explain each step of your reasoning through what changes 
    are required and why. 

    Pay attention to changes you make and impacts to external dependencies in the pom.xml as well as changes 
    to imports we need to consider.

    As you make changes that impact the pom.xml or imports, be sure you explain what needs to be updated.
    
    After you have shared your step by step thinking, provide a full output of the updated file:

    # Input information
    ## Issue found from static code analysis of the Java EE code which needs to be fixed to migrate to Quarkus
    Issue to fix:  "Remote EJBs are not supported in Quarkus, and therefore its use must be removed and replaced with REST functionality. In order to do this:
 1. Replace the `@Remote` annotation on the class with a `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path("<endpoint>")` annotation. An endpoint must be added to the annotation in place of `<endpoint>` to specify the actual path to the REST service.
 2. Remove `@Stateless` annotations if present. Given that REST services are stateless by nature, it makes it unnecessary.
 3. For every public method on the EJB being converted, do the following:
 - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET`
 - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path("<endpoint>")` and give it a proper endpoint path. As a rule of thumb, the method name can be used as endpoint, for instance:
 ```
 @Path("/increment")
 public void increment() 
 ```
 - Add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam("<param-name>")` to any method parameters if needed, where `<param-name>` is a name for the parameter."
